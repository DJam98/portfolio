              <h2>Capitol Theatre Design</h2>
              <span class="description">
                As a part of the <i>Heightened Multi-sensory Experiences</i> class, there was an opportunity to design an experience in the RMIT Capitol Theatre. The project was made to enhance a competitive viewing experience, and there were two intentions behind this. The first was to provide additional context to those unfamiliar with the game to be more aware of who was in the lead and to make the experience more exciting and engaging to all viewers making full use of the RGB theatre.              </span>

              <h2>UX Design</h2>
              <span class="description">
                This was a project developed for a <i>UX/UI</i> university course. The concept was to create a mobile application to lock the userâ€™s phones, connect to their lights within their room and switch it to a different colour to replicate the idea of transitioning to another space to enhance user engagement and focus on the task that they wished to complete. This design was completed using a Figma prototype.              </span>
