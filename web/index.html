                This was a project designed to enhance the Player One radio show (hosted on SYN 70.9FM) and make our show more accessible. The purpose of this was to provide the song/artist names that were currently playing, just played, and up next to provide more context to the audience watching the video live stream.              </span>

                The project was an experiment to create a blog post website for one of my university classes, <i> Transformative Colour Resonance and Environments</i>. This site integrates filters and is completely built using Flexbox to make it easier to navigate and easily adaptable for responsive design.              </span>

                This site in itself is completely coded by hand to allow complete control of the design. The idea behind this design is to create a personal relationship with the viewer by having the full and complete focus on the text, which is also enhanced by the fact that to actually interact with the site they need to place their mouse within this text, and almost physically moving themselves closer to me. It was also built with scalability in mind so it would be easy to place future projects onto this site.</span>
