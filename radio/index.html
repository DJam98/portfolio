              Between 2022 and 2023, I was the executive producer and host of a radio show called Player One, which was hosted on SYN FM (90.7FM). In these two years, I was primarily in control of the direction of the entire show and hosted a majority of the shows, which were broadcast live almost every week throughout those two years.            </span>
